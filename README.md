An xunit-style unit test framework for PegaRULES Process Commander (PRPC).

PRUnit is a unit testing framework modeled after the xUnit family of testing frameworks for [Pegasystems'](http://www.pega.com) PegaRULES Process Commander (PRPC). PRPC is a development platform created by Pegasystems for building workflow and rules-based BPM applications.

Unit tests built with PRUnit take the form of activities. PRUnit supplies many different "Assert" activities that can be invoked from your test activities (just like 'assert()' methods using JUnit are invoked from your 'test' methods).
